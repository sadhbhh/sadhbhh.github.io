  <p>People tend to judge and hate my music taste for no reason other than because they are closed minded, so I decided to make a website talking about it just to spite them :)</p>

    <h3> <em>OBBSESSIVE - Chase Atlantic</em><h2>
      
      <p>I've been absolutely addicted to this song lately. I love the beat and the tune, and the way it brings the saxophone, a traditional jazz instrument, into alternative pop. </p>
  
      
      <h2><em>So far (it's alright) - The 1975</em><h2>
        <p>I am a massive fan of The 1975. I think my favourite thing about this song is the twinkley piano ostinato. </p>
