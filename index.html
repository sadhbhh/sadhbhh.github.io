  <h4>People tend to judge and hate my music taste for no reason other than because they are closed minded, so I decided to make a website talking about it just to spite them :)</h4>

    <h3> <em>OBBSESSIVE - Chase Atlantic</em></h3>
      
      <p>I've been absolutely addicted to this song lately. I love the beat and the tune, and the way it brings the saxophone, a traditional jazz instrument, into alternative pop. </p>
  
      
      <h3><em>So far (it's alright) - The 1975</em></h3>
        <p>I am a massive fan of The 1975. I think my favourite thing about this song is the twinkley piano ostinato. </p>
        
       <h3><em>Feeling - COIN</em></h3>
         
        <h3><em>Young Dumb And Broke - Khalid</em><h3> 
          <p>I really like Khalid, his music is so chill and you can vibe to it.</p>
